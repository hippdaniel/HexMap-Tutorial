# HexMap-Tutorial
A following of the HexMap-Tutorial from Jasper Flick (https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map)  
and of the Camera-Tutorial with the new Unity Input from Stacey (https://gamedev-resources.com/tutorials-2/new-input-system-tutorials)

I worked through the tutorials by writing it all myself and want to use it in some changed version later in my own projects.
